# Silverback: A responsive theme for middleman-blog

Silverback is a theme built for [middleman-blog][] which in turn runs on the
[Middleman][] static site generator. As you would expect in this day and age, it's
responsive and relatively lightweight with 10KB of CSS and no JS. A live demo
can be seen here: http://elliotekj.com.

## Installation

1. If you don't already have Middleman installed, do so ([official docs][]):

```
$ gem install middleman
```

2. Now `cd` into the parent directory of your new project and run:

```
$ middleman init MY_PROJECT_FOLDER -T elliotekj/middleman-silverback
```

You'll be asked whether or not you want to use LiveReload. I would highly
recommend doing so.

You're good to go.

## Usage

If you have never used Middleman before then [this page][] will get you started.
Briefly put, `cd` into the directory the Middleman command we ran above just created
then run:

```
$ bundle exec middleman serve
```

That will get you running on localhost. To generate all of the static pages,
run:

```
$ bundle exec middleman build
```

Silverback comes with a number of options, all of which are configurable and
documented within `config.rb`. Here's a rundown of them:
